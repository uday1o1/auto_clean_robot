# Autonomous Cleaning Robot (Computer Vision Module)

This project was part of a **college-funded seed grant** to design and prototype an **autonomous cleaning robot** from scratch.

The robot integrates:

* **SLAM & navigation** (developed by a teammate - [coverage planner repo](https://github.com/JatinPatil2003/CleaningRobot))
* **Computer vision & machine learning** (this repo - my contribution)

The **goal** was to enable the robot not only to move autonomously and map rooms efficiently, but also to:

* Dynamically **detect and avoid obstacles** (people, pets, furniture, objects)
* **Identify unclean environments** such as spills, dirty floors, and small garbage
* Guide the cleaning mechanism toward those detected regions

---

## ✅ Key Contributions

* Built a **custom dataset** in Roboflow tailored for cleaning robot needs.
* Performed a **comparative analysis** of six transfer learning algorithms.
* Trained & evaluated models across YOLO, EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DETR, and InceptionV3.
* Produced a **research paper (under review)** based on findings.
* Integrated vision module into the robot prototype with working demos.

## Dataset

Due to a lack of suitable open-source datasets, I built a **custom dataset in Roboflow**:
 [Cleaning Bot Dataset 2.0 on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/test-hmoom/cleaning_bot_dataset_2.0)

**Classes created:**

* `home_object`
* `waste`
* `spill`
* `person`
* `pet`
